      <h1>Howdy! I'm Nathan.</h1>
      <p>I'm an aspiring software developer from the heart of West Virginia,
        although I've also dabbled in cybersecurity and data analysis. I'm a
        recent graduate from West Virginia University (2025), where I majored in
        Computer Science with an area of emphasis in Cybersecurity and a minor
        in Applied Mathematics. I'm also a big Linux and free software
        enthusiast, and I love finding new ways to make my computing experience
        more enjoyable. Most of my work as a developer has been in school
        projects, but I do have a few high-quality side projects and some
        scripts to show off, too. Feel free to look around!</p>
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: clearly, I haven't finished setting up this
        website yet, so apologies if you're seeing this before I've uploaded
        anything. I'll be sure to get things up and running soon.</p>
