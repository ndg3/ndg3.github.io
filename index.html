    <h1>Howdy! I'm Nathan.</h1>
    <p>I'm an aspiring software developer from the heart of West Virginia, although I've also dabbled in cybersecurity and data analysis. I'm a recent graduate from West Virginia University (2025), where I majored in Computer Science with an area of emphasis in Cybersecurity and a minor in Applied Mathematics. I'm also a big Linux and free software enthusiast, and I love finding new ways to make my computing experience more enjoyable. Most of my work as a developer has been in school projects, but I do have a few high-quality side projects and some scripts to show off, too. Feel free to look around!</p>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: clearly, I haven't finished setting up this website yet, so apologies if you're seeing this before I've uploaded anything. I'll be sure to get things up and running soon.</p>
